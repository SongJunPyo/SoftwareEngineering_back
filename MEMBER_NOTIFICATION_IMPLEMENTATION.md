# Project Member Assignment Notification Implementation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of real-time notifications and WebSocket events when users are added as project members.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/routers/project_members.py`
**Function**: `accept_invitation()` (lines 239-286)

**Changes Made**:
- Added proper notification creation for newly added member using `create_project_notification()`
- Added WebSocket event emission using `event_emitter.emit_project_member_added()`
- Enhanced the invitation acceptance flow to include real-time updates

**Key Improvements**:
```python
# New member gets notification about being added to project
await create_project_notification(
    db=db,
    user_id=current_user.user_id,
    project_id=project.project_id,
    project_name=project.title,
    notification_type="project_member_added",
    actor_name=None  # Self-accepted invitation
)

# WebSocket event for real-time updates
await event_emitter.emit_project_member_added(
    project_id=project.project_id,
    workspace_id=request.workspace_id,
    project_name=project.title,
    member_id=current_user.user_id,
    member_name=current_user.name,
    role=invitation.role,
    added_by=invitation.invited_by
)
```

### 2. `/backend/routers/projects.py`
**Function**: `add_project_member()` (lines 26-62)

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced generic notification with proper `create_project_notification()`
- Added WebSocket event emission for real-time updates
- Added proper user information retrieval for WebSocket events

**Key Improvements**:
```python
# Proper project notification instead of generic notification
await create_project_notification(
    db=db,
    user_id=user_id,
    project_id=project_id,
    project_name=project.title,
    notification_type="project_member_added",
    actor_name=current_user.name
)

# WebSocket event for real-time updates
await event_emitter.emit_project_member_added(
    project_id=project_id,
    workspace_id=0,  # Direct addition - workspace_id can be parameterized if needed
    project_name=project.title,
    member_id=user_id,
    member_name=added_user.name if added_user else "Unknown User",
    role=role,
    added_by=current_user.user_id
)
```

## Implementation Details

### Notification Types
1. **`project_member_added`**: Sent to the newly added member
2. **`invitation_accepted`**: Sent to the original inviter when invitation is accepted

### WebSocket Events
1. **`PROJECT_MEMBER_ADDED`**: Broadcasted to the entire project room
2. **Personal notification**: Sent directly to the new member
3. **Auto room joining**: New member automatically joins the project room

### Real-time Features
- ✅ **Database notification**: Stored in the notifications table
- ✅ **WebSocket broadcast**: Real-time update to all project members  
- ✅ **Personal message**: Direct notification to the new member
- ✅ **Room management**: New member automatically joins project WebSocket room

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Real-time Updates**: All project members receive immediate notifications when someone new joins
2. **Proper Notification Management**: Uses the dedicated project notification system
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Leverages existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time communication
4. **User Experience**: New members get proper welcome notifications
5. **Consistency**: Both invitation acceptance and direct member addition now follow the same notification pattern

## Error Handling
- WebSocket events are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent notification failures from blocking member addition
- Database operations use transactions to ensure consistency
- Fallback handling for missing user information

## Testing
A test script (`test_member_notification.py`) has been created to verify:
- Module imports work correctly
- Function signatures are correct
- Implementation logic is sound

## Usage Flow

### When User Accepts Invitation:
1. User accepts project invitation
2. `ProjectMember` record is created
3. Notification sent to new member: "You've been added to 'Project Name'"
4. Notification sent to inviter: "User accepted your invitation"
5. WebSocket event broadcasted to all project members
6. New member joins project WebSocket room

### When Admin Directly Adds Member:
1. Admin adds user via direct API
2. `ProjectMember` record is created  
3. Notification sent to new member: "Admin added you to 'Project Name'"
4. WebSocket event broadcasted to all project members
5. New member joins project WebSocket room

## Dependencies
- `backend.routers.notifications.create_project_notification`
- `backend.websocket.events.event_emitter`
